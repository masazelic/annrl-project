# ANN/Reinforcement learning project: Mountain Car environment  

Project was done as the part of the coursework for the CS-456: ANN/Reinforcement learning.  

Repository contains: 
* `MP1_Miniproject.ipynb` - Jupiter Notebook containing the code implementing Random Agent, DQN (Deep Q Learning ) Agent with and without heuristic for the reward and with Random Network Distillation, and Dyna agent. All the code id developed in `torch`.
* `MP1_Miniproject.pdf` - Report explaining and discussing the results.
